## A. Problem Context
The goal of this project is to set up a data warehouse that integrates Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) along with related reference data focused on commodities trading. The goal is to integrate trade data with related reference information such as asset types, contract details, and trade volumes to enable efficient analysis. One of the key objectives is to identify the most frequently traded assets in the commodities market, providing insights into market activity and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## E. Methodology and Implementation

** This project followed a Waterfall methodology, proceeding through distinct, sequential phases. Each stage was completed before moving to the next, ensuring structured planning, execution, and documentation **

**ðŸ“Œ Project Phases**
Phase 1: 
- Setup and Data Collection
- Defined project scope and goals
- Set up cloud infrastructure and repository
- Collected CME trading datasets and reference data

Phase 2: 
- Data Processing and Modeling
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python and DBT
- Designed the data warehouse schema based on dimensional modeling
- Implemented medallion architecture: Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), Gold (aggregated)

Phase 3: 
- Metadata Management
- Created a comprehensive data dictionary
- Mapped source fields to warehouse schema
- Documented ETL/ELT processes

Phase 4: 
- Visualization and Analysis
- Built Tableau dashboards and analytical views
- Supported drill-down analysis and KPI insights
- Final testing and deployment



## ðŸ§¾ Metadata Management
**Data Dictionary**
- Field names, data types, and descriptions
- Source system mapping


**Source-to-Target Mapping**
- Documented flow from raw data to the analytics layer





Function	Description
extract_cme_data()	Extract raw CME files
transform_data()	Clean and structure for loading
load_to_snowflake()	Load processed data into Snowflake

## ETL vs ELT Strategy
- ETL (Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Load): Used for initial cleaning before DBT
- ELT (Extract â†’ Load â†’ Transform): Leveraged within Snowflake for DBT transformations

## Tools & Technologies
- Cloud Platform: Azure
- Warehouse: Snowflake
- Orchestration: DBT
- Database: MySQL
- Languages: Python
- BI Tool: Tableau


## F. Visualization
Provide details of the visualizations created for the project.

- Include charts, graphs, and any other visual representation of the data.
